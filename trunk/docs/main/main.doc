\section Definition

The goal of the NHI1 project is to create an artificial (non human) intelligence until 2040.

and the internet global computer network lead to the possibility to create the first Non Human \n
Intelligence until 2040. \n
The question is not if this will happen, the question is only if this intelligence will be open \n

or will be closed\n
(<I>controlled by a single company or by a single government</I>).\n
