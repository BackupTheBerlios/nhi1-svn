libmsgque overview
==================

The msgque project is an infrastructure to link applications together 
to act like a single application. To link mean distributing work from 
one application to an other application an wait or not wait for an 
answer. 
The linking is done using network or local sockets and is based on 
packages send from one application to an other application and back. 
The libmsgque project is used to handle all the different aspects for 
setup and maintain the link and is responsible for:

 * starting and stopping the different applications
 * starting and stopping the communication interface
 * sending and receiving packages
 * reading and writing data from or into packages
 * setup and maintain the event-handling for asynchronous transfers
 * propagate warnings or errors


libmsgque build
===============

"libmsgque" is a able to build on a UNIX operating system like
Linux, BSD. For a build on Windows please change into the 
"win" directory and follow the instructions from the "README.win" 
file.

The main development system is:

    SuSE Linux 10.3 on "Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6600 @ 2.40GHz"

The software-build was also tested on:

    Windows XP ServicePack 3  (VirtualBox/Intel)
    Free BSD 7.1	      (VirtualBox/Intel)
    SuSE Linux 11	      (VirtualBox/Intel)
    Debian 5		      (iBook/ppc)

The Build depends on the following tools:

  - Compiler: gcc
  - Make: make
  - Configuration: libtool, autoconf-2.62 and automake-1.10
  - Test: tcl using the "tcltest" package
  - Documentation: doxygen
  - Create Binary Distribution: zip

In addition the following software is required for the "build"
and is used to test the "libmsgque" 

  - tcl from the Tcl Developer Site
       -> http://www.tcl.tk/

In addition the following software *can* be added but is *not*
required:

  - java from the JAVA Download Site
       -> google: java 6 download

  - python - python 3.x is required
       -> http://www.python.org/download/

  - C# - csharp or mono
       -> http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page

To build "libmsgque" please follow the next steps:

Unpack the source distribution in a temporary directory and
switch into the top directory:

  > tar -xzf libmsgque-X.Y.tar.gz
  > cd libmsgque-X.Y

To build the software on a system other than the developing system I
recommend to update your local build tools with:

  > autoreconf -f -i -v

To configure the build run the "configure" script:
 
  # for help
  > bash ./configure --help

  # do the configuration
  > bash ./configure ...

To build the software run "make":

  > make

To test the software please follow the steps from:

  > less tests/README.tests

To build the "documentation" the tool "doxygen" is required:

  - create the documentation
    > make html
  - read the documentation
    > firefox html/index.htm

If the build is done on a *new* hardware/os version the binaries
can be submitted to the community using the following steps:

  - create a binary distribution
    > bash ./make_binary_dist.sh
  - the new binary-distribution is created in the directory
    > binary-dist
  - contact the maintainer
