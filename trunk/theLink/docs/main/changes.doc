\section V0_6 16 Feb 2010 - NHI1-0.6, PLMK-1.5 and libmsgque-4.4

This is a \e major-feature-release to prepare the environment for the new 
\e milestone-release coming soon

\subsection V0_6_gc New memory cleanup using Garbage-Collection

To find the \e right moment to delete an mamory-allocated object is the
most difficult part in a complex software. To solve this problem I 
introduce a \e refCount based \e Garbage-Collection. This is not an easy
step because the \e GC have to cooperate with all the existing \e GC
implementations available in the high-level programming languages like
\AllLng{syn}.





\section V0_5 1 Feb 2010 - NHI1-0.5, PLMK-1.4 and libmsgque-4.3

This is a \e feature-release to prepare the environment for the new 
\e milestone-release coming soon

\subsection V0_5_con Recover from a Server or a Network downtime

\subsubsection V0_5_con_old Old Behaviour

A \e server-downtime is equivalent with a broken \e client-server-link and result in an 
\e exit-error-code from a \e link-access-operation. This error usually end in
a \RNSA{ContextDelete} operation and the entire environment, including the local variables,
is lost. No functions are available to act on the \e exit-error-code and to \e re-connect
the server.

\subsubsection V0_5_con_new New Behaviour

Starting with the release \b libmsgque-4.3 two functions are available to act on
the \e exit-error-code.
-# \RNSA{ErrorIsEXIT}: in an \e error-handler separate the \e exit-error 
   from the \e normal-error
-# \RNSA{LinkConnect}: do a \e re-connect on a broken \e client-server-link
.

These two functions can be used together with \RNSC{ignoreExit}, 
\RNSC{IEvent} and \RNSA{ErrorSetCONTINUE} to build a filter to cache a 
\e service-request and guarantee the delivery.

\subsection V0_5_ident Identify the link-target

\subsubsection V0_5_ident_def Definition

A \e link-target is the direct neighbour and the identification of the \e link-target is used to
modify the local behaviour. In different to \RNSC{name} the \RNSC{ident} is set by the
programmer and can \b not be changed by the user. The goal is to give every major 
\e application a unique name like: \c "PayrollServer-V1.7" or \c "DocuStoreClient-V1.7-USR-aotto1968". 
This ident is exchanged during \e link-startup and can be retrieved with
\RNSA{LinkGetTargetIdent}.

\subsubsection V0_5_ident_example C++ Example from the file "theLink/example/cc/Filter4.cc"

In the \e service-handler \b LOGF decide to use the \e string-data local or to send the \e string-data to the \e link-target
\dontinclude Filter4.cc

\skip LOGF
\until SendRETURN
