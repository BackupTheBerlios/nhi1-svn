In difference to the client/server link the master/slave link connect two independent \parent_context 
in the same process or thread (e.g. node). This leading to the restriction that only one \master_context 
can be a \server_context because only one server per node is possible.

\section master_detail What is a "master" context ?

 - the \e master-context is a \parent_context without a \child_context available.
 - the \e master-context is a \client_context or a \server_context.
 - the \e master-context is responsible to create or delete the \child_context of the \e slave.
 - the \e master-context is responsible to delete the \parent_context of the \e slave.
 - the \e link between the \master_context and the \slave_context is done using the \libmsgque
   slave API: \AllLng{SlaveWorker}
 .

\section slave_detail What is a "slave" context ?
 
 - the \e slave-context is a \parent_context without a \child_context available.
 - the \e slave-context is a \client_context.
 - the \e slave-context lifetime is controlled by the \master_context.
 - the \e slave-context report all error-messages to the \master_context.
 - a special form of a \slave_context is a \worker_context
 .

\section worker_detail What is a "worker" context ?
 - the \e worker-context is a \slave_context using the image of the \master_context self.
 - the \master_context have to be a \server_context.
 - the \e worker-context is create with its own constructor: \AllLng{SlaveWorker}
 - the \e worker-context is identified by a \e unique integer starting with \c 0.
