\section V0_9 08 Nov 2010 - NHI1-0.9, PLMK-1.7 und libmsgque-4.7

This version adds the ability to:

- \msgqueforphp "PHP" language support.
- a new interface of the \RNSA{ProcessEvent} function and the \RNSC{startAs} configuration option.
- terminate an application from a callback with the \RNSA{ErrorSetEXIT} function.

The PHP language is characterized by an extensive but undocumented C API. The number of 
features combined with a growing and moving language made the extension programming difficult
and lengthy. The successful PHP extension shows the flexibility and adaptability of NHI1.

\section V0_8 22 Oct 2010 - NHI1-0.8, PLMK-1.6 und libmsgque-4.6

This release adds the ability to:

- <A HREF="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</A> language support (LNG)
- L)anguage A)bstraction L)ayer (\ref MqLalS)
- G)arbage C)ollection Object-Mark (\ref MqMark)

Ruby is an object-oriented programming language like Python.
The new \libmsgque C-function \ref MqMark was added to the GC support and marks all objects
that are referenced within 'libmsgque'. The programmer now has the opportunity to replace 
internal functions such as: \ref MqLalS::SysCalloc "SysCalloc", \ref MqLalS::SysMalloc "SysMalloc", 
\ref MqLalS::SysRealloc "SysRealloc", \ref MqLalS::SysFree "SysFree", \ref MqLalS::SysSelect "SysSelect", 
\ref MqLalS::SysFork "SysFork", \ref MqLalS::SysServerSpawn "SysServerSpawn", 
\ref MqLalS::SysServerThread "SysServerThread", \ref MqLalS::SysServerFork "SysServerFork", 
\ref MqLalS::SysWait "SysWait", \ref MqLalS::SysUSleep "SysUSleep", \ref MqLalS::SysSleep "SysSleep", 
\ref MqLalS::SysDaemonize "SysDaemonize", \ref MqLalS::SysExit "SysExit", \ref MqLalS::SysAbort "SysAbort" 
to adapt to the environment (\ref MqLalS).

\section V0_7 08 Mar 2010 - NHI1-0.7, PLMK-1.6 and libmsgque-4.5

This is a \e major-feature-release to add \e longtime-transaction support.

\subsection V0_7_lt longtime-transaction support

A \e longtime-transaction is a transaction with an infinite time period between the start 
and the end. A \e longtime-transaction is always a \e persistent-transaction
too. The \e persistent support is available as an in-memory solution on the \e application-server
or in an additional \e bidirectional-filter, with local storage, available for the next release.\n

A typical scenario for a \e longtime-transaction is:
- A user with a client connect to the server and start a \e longtime-transaction job. 
After a while the user shutdown the client and leave the office. At the next morning the
user start the client again and the results are send from the server to the client.
- On a space mission the time-overhead between transaction start and end is large. It is
usually not possible to keep the client-server-connection open all the time.
- On a military action-system the enemy try to interrupted the client-server-connection
to disable data communication.
.

To use a \e longtime-transaction the results are send to a \e client-service registered with
\RNSA{ServiceCreate}. This service and addtional data (I call this data \e local-context-data)
have to be added to the \e longterm-transaction package to be available in the result. On the 
\e link-target the \e local-context-data is initial stripped from the \e data-package and is 
later added to the results again.\n

The \e local-context-data is added to the \e data-package with \RNSA{SendT_START} and
\RNSA{SendT_END}. The \e local-context-data is read from the \e data-package with 
\RNSA{ReadT_START} and \RNSA{ReadT_END}.

\subsection V0_7_sp service proxy support

A \e service-proxy (\RNSA{ServiceProxy}) is used to forward the entire \e data-package from one 
context to an other context and is used in a \e filter like environment.

\section V0_6 16 Feb 2010 - NHI1-0.6, PLMK-1.5 and libmsgque-4.4

This is a \e major-feature-release to prepare the environment for the new 
\e milestone-release coming soon

\subsection V0_6_gc Performing memory cleanup using Garbage-Collection

To find a \e safe moment to free unused memory is the
most difficult part in a complex software. To solve this problem 
a \e refCount based \e Garbage-Collection has been introduced. This is not an easy
step because the \e GC have to cooperate with the \RNSA{syn,callback-language} 
memory cleanup technology.
To achive this goal a very \e conservative strategy was applied. \b No cleanup
of lost objects is performed (this is the job of the \e callback-languages).
Only deleted objects (\RNSA{ContextDelete}) with a #MqS::refCount > 0
are added into the \e GC-Pool. The cleanup is done with the following conditions:
- \RNSA{ProcessEvent} with the \e FOREVER flag (this is the \e main-loop)
  after an event was processed.
- \RNSA{Exit}, on thread or process exit
- on application-exit
.
The #MqS::refCount is increased with \b ++ and decreased with \b --. The
default #MqS::refCount is \b 0. \n
The refCount is modified to protect the calling object:
- during a \RNSA{ProcessEvent} call
- in a \e callback
- during an \e event-action task, example: \RNSC{IEvent}
.

\subsection V0_6_log New message-logging API

The \PLMK logging was opened to give the user the abillity to create a \PLMK
conform logging message on stderr.\n
The following functions were added:
- \RNSA{LogC}, to write a string message
- \b LogV (\ref c_LogV "C", \ref cc_LogV "C++"), to write a \e printf style message
- \b LogVL (\ref c_LogVL "C", \ref cc_LogVL "C++"), to write a \e vprintf style message
.

\section V0_5 1 Feb 2010 - NHI1-0.5, PLMK-1.4 and libmsgque-4.3

This is a \e feature-release to prepare the environment for the new 
\e milestone-release coming soon

\subsection V0_5_con Recover from a Server or a Network downtime

\subsubsection V0_5_con_old Old Behaviour

A \e server-downtime is equivalent with a broken \e client-server-link and result in an 
\e exit-error-code from a \e link-access-operation. This error usually end in
a \RNSA{ContextDelete} operation and the entire environment, including the local variables,
is lost. No functions are available to act on the \e exit-error-code and to \e re-connect
the server.

\subsubsection V0_5_con_new New Behaviour

Starting with the release \b libmsgque-4.3 two functions are available to act on
the \e exit-error-code.
-# \RNSA{ErrorIsEXIT}: in an \e error-handler separate the \e exit-error 
   from the \e normal-error
-# \RNSA{LinkConnect}: do a \e re-connect on a broken \e client-server-link
.

These two functions can be used together with \RNSC{ignoreExit}, 
\RNSC{IEvent} and \RNSA{ErrorSetCONTINUE} to build a filter to cache a 
\e service-request and guarantee the delivery.

\subsubsection V0_5_con_example C++ Example from the file "theLink/example/cc/Filter4.cc"
\dontinclude Filter4.cc

\subsection V0_5_ident Identify the link-target

\subsubsection V0_5_ident_def Definition

A \e link-target is the direct neighbour and the identification of the \e link-target is used to
modify the local behaviour. In different to \RNSC{name} the \RNSC{ident} is set by the
programmer and can \b not be changed by the user. The goal is to give every major 
\e application a unique name like: \c "PayrollServer-V1.7" or \c "DocuStoreClient-V1.7-USR-aotto1968". 
This ident is exchanged during \e link-startup and can be retrieved with
\RNSA{LinkGetTargetIdent}.

\subsubsection V0_5_ident_example C++ Example from the file "theLink/example/cc/Filter4.cc"

In the \e service-handler \b LOGF decide to use the \e string-data local or to send the \e string-data to the \e link-target
\dontinclude Filter4.cc

\skip LOGF
\until SendRETURN
