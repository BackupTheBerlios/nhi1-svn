NHI1 overview

NHI1 build
===============

"NHI1" is able to build on a UNIX operating system like Linux, 
BSD. For a build on Windows please change into the "win" directory 
and follow the instructions from the "README.win" file.
http://www.ruby-lang.org/
The main development system is:

    SuSE Linux 11 (64bit) on "Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6600 @ 2.40GHz"

The software-build was also tested on:

    Windows XP ServicePack 3  (VirtualBox/Intel)
    Free BSD 7.1	      (VirtualBox/Intel)
    SuSE Linux 11 (32bit)     (VirtualBox/Intel)
    Debian 5		      (iBook/ppc)

The Build depends on the following tools:

  - Compiler: gcc
  - Make: make
  - Configuration: libtool-2.2.6, autoconf-2.63 and automake-1.10.1
  - Test: tclsh-8.5.6 using the "tcltest" package
  - Documentation: doxygen
  - Create Binary Distribution: zip

In addition the following software is also supported:

  - tcl from the Tcl Developer Site
       -> http://www.tcl.tk/

  - java from the JAVA Download Site
       -> google: java 6 download

  - python - python 3.x is required
       -> http://www.python.org/download/

  - C# - csharp or mono
       -> http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page

  - perl from The Perl Programming Language
       -> http://www.perl.org/

  - ruby - ruby 1.9.2p0 (2010-08-18 revision 29036)
       -> http://www.ruby-lang.org/

To build "NHI1" please follow the next steps:

Unpack the source distribution in a temporary directory and
switch into the top directory:

  > tar -xzf NHI1-X.Y.tar.gz
  > cd NHI1-X.Y

To build the software on a system other than the developing system I
recommend to update your local build tools with:

  > autoreconf -f -i -v

To configure the build run the "configure" script:
 
  # for help
  > bash ./configure --help

  # do the configuration
  > bash ./configure ...

To build the software run "make":

  > make

To test the software please follow the steps from:

  > less theLink/tests/README.tests

To build the "documentation" the tool "doxygen" is required:

  - create the documentation
    > make html
  - read the documentation
    > firefox html/theLink/index.htm

If the build is done on a *new* hardware/os version the binaries
can be submitted to the community using the following steps:

  - create a binary distribution
    > bash ./bin/make_binary_dist.sh
  - the new binary-distribution is created in the directory
    > binary-dist
  - contact the maintainer
